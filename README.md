## Projects
### Classification of Lung Pathologies in Neonates Using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform
[Publication](https://biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12938-023-01184-x)

Developed a framework for classifying the six most common neonatal lung pathologies using spatially localized line and texture patterns extracted via 2D dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). This data-driven approach combined clinical knowledge and machine learning to better characterization of neonatal lung diseases by identifying line and texture patterns that were associated with the diseases. The proposed method provides a fully automated point-of-care tool that could screen and capture LUS morphologies associated with neonatal lung pathologies could aid in rapid and accurate diagnosis.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
