### Classification of Lung Pathologies in Neonates Using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform
[Publication](https://biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12938-023-01184-x)

Developed a framework for classifying the six most common neonatal lung pathologies using spatially localized line and texture patterns extracted via 2D dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). This data-driven approach combined clinical knowledge and machine learning to better characterization of neonatal lung diseases by identifying line and texture patterns that were associated with the diseases. The proposed method provides a fully automated point-of-care tool that could screen and capture LUS morphologies associated with neonatal lung pathologies could aid in rapid and accurate diagnosis.

### Object Detection and Tracking of Lung Ultrasound Signs in Neonates Using YOLO and DeepSORT



Developed a model to automatically identify and track significant features or abnormalities within lung ultrasound images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, it aims to enhance the efficiency of diagnosing and monitoring pulmonary conditions. 
- **Algorithm:** Implement a tracking algorithm (e.g., DeepSORT) to associate detected lung ultrasound signs across frames.
- **Motion Prediction:** Used Kalman filter for estimating the trajectory of objects over time.
- **Data Interface:** Develop an interface for seamless integration with existing clinical systems and databases.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Enable real-time monitoring of lung ultrasound signs during examinations.
- **Visualization:** Generate visualizations highlighting detected lung ultrasound signs and their temporal evolution.
